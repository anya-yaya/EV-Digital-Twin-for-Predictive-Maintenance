Predictive Maintenance Digital Twin: Developed an Electric Vehicle (EV) Digital Twin leveraging real-time telemetry to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for key components (Battery, Tires) and classify Motor Faults.

Machine Learning Implementation: Engineered a multi-model architecture integrating LSTM for sequence-based battery RUL prediction and Random Forest Regressors/Classifiers for tire RUL and motor fault diagnosis, deploying the entire system via a Streamlit dashboard.
